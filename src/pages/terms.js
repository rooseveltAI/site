      <h2>Your Right in the Content</h2>
      <p>
        You retain your rights to any Content you submit, post or display on or
        through the Services. What’s yours is yours — you own your Content (and
        your incorporated audio, photos and videos are considered part of the
        Content). By submitting, posting or displaying Content on or through the
        Services, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license
        (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt,
        modify, publish, transmit, display and distribute such Content in any
        and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed).
        This license authorizes us to make your Content available to the rest of
        the world and to let others do the same. You agree that this license
        includes the right for weBelong to provide, promote, and improve the
        Services and to make Content submitted to or through the Services
        available to other companies, organizations or individuals for the
        syndication, broadcast, distribution, promotion or publication of such
        Content on other media and services, subject to our terms and conditions
        for such Content use. Such additional uses by us, or other companies,
        organizations or individuals, may be made with no compensation paid to
        you with respect to the Content that you submit, post, transmit or
        otherwise make available through the Services.

        prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without
        limitation if you breach the Terms. All provisions of the Terms which by
